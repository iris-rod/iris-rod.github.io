# Latest Projects

## Currently working on

Right now, I'm focusing on developing my C++ knowledge through an Udemy course in Unreal (85% done!) and also going back to the basics of C++ programming. My foundations on this language must be strong enough to learn more and improve.

## Escape Room online course

I created a small Escape Room type game through an online game development course for Unreal. It was really good to get more familiar with the Unreal engine and also pratice more C++ programming.

It's still a work in progress, there are some tweaks and improvements I want to make, specially on mechanics, but here is a small video with the result for now [Escape Room Gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAG7DJLP4Wc&fbclid=IwAR2s-0OFEO4bl5hCrYkkphk93dvLu1vOGNSZ19BmfHMGL5sV4sVDTJ0R7y8) (It has some subtitles along that provide some explanation on the gameplay and how it is working)

# Latest Projects

## Currently working on

Right now, I'm focusing on developing my C++ knowledge by going back to the basics of C++ programming since my foundations on this language must be strong enough to learn more and improve. I just finished a small project using only SDL libraries and the next challenge I'll take on will be on Unreal Engine. Stay tune for more updates!


## Puzzle tile game

This is a small project that I started last year with the goal to improve my algorithm and general C++ knowledge. I also wanted to implement a simple event based system in this game. IT is a very simple game: there are pieces of different colors randomnly generated in columns and pushed into the board. Whenever there are 2 or more pieces of the same color connected to each other (either verticaly or horizontaly) you can click on them to remove them from the board and gain points. The goal is to reach the number of points to advance to the next level before the board reaches the end of the platform.

## Breaking Dev 2018 Participation

I participated in the Breaking Dev 2018 edition at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico Campus TagusPark and created another multiplayer game, this time in a two-man team. We made it all from scratch, except the sounds. It was a full-on weekend of drawing and coding, but it was a lot of fun!

Dare to face your fears in your own dreams with the help of your trust worthy teddy bear!

## Game to teach Organic Chemistry
This is the final project of my MSc which I am currently working on. It is a game to teach Organic Chemistry to highschool students that uses Virtual Reality technology and the Leap Motion sensor. The player is immersed in a virtual world where he can grab atoms with his own hands and create and manipulate molecules.

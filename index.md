## Global Game Jam 2019 Participation

"It's cleaning day and the whole family has to clean up the house! However, not everyone agrees on what should go where. The toilet paper doesn't always show up in the bathroom, and some socks are stored away in the kitchen. Try to clean the house the way that makes you feel like home!"

This game jam was a different experience from the previous game jams that I had already participated in, but still fun and a good opportunity to explore new things. The whole concept of this jam was to use Sugar, a social gamification asset that helps adding competitive, cooperative and goal based mechanics.

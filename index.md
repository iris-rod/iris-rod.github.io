# Latest Projects

## Currently working on

Right now, I'm focusing on developing my C++ knowledge by going back to the basics of C++ programming since my foundations on this language must be strong enough to learn more and improve. I'm working on smaller projects, trying to implement different mechanics and using different methods to broaden my skills. The latest project I made is a simple puzzle game which I'll be updating it's final results soon! You can follow its progress [here](https://github.com/iris-rod/PuzzleGame). The next challenge I'll take on will be on Unreal Engine.

## Global Game Jam 2021

"A game about a mustache trying to be reunited with his owner in a world were mustaches are illegal.

To help you to identify the correct store your owner is in keep an eye on the mustachometer that indicates how close you are, get inside the store and be reunited with your maker."

## Escape Room online course

I created a small Escape Room type game through an online game development course for Unreal. It was really good to get more familiar with the Unreal engine and also pratice more C++ programming.

It's still a work in progress, there are some tweaks and improvements I want to make, specially on mechanics, but here is a small video with the result for now [Escape Room Gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAG7DJLP4Wc&fbclid=IwAR2s-0OFEO4bl5hCrYkkphk93dvLu1vOGNSZ19BmfHMGL5sV4sVDTJ0R7y8) (It has some subtitles along that provide some explanation on the gameplay and how it is working)

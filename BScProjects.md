# BSc Projects

## Gestura: Game with gestures using Leap Motion

This was a game that I made in my final project in my BSc in Computer Engeneering and Multimedia. It is a turn-based fighting multiplayer game created in Unity that uses the Leap Motion sensor, allowing the player to use his own hands to play the game, instead of using the traditional keyboard and mouse or controller.

## Other smaller projects

### Hive
This was the final project of one of the programming classes I took in my first year of BSc. We had to create the board game Hive in Java from scratch with all of the different rules of movement for each piece.
 
### Soul Syphon
This was also a final project for one of the programming classes of my first year of BSc. We had to create a game, in Python, based on three mechanics:
- There had to be some type of 'diver';
- 'Treasures' to the 'diver' collect;
- The 'diver' had to avoid 'sharks';

Since the concept could be changed, Soul Syphon was born. You roam the Twilight Realm as the Grim Reaper collecting the lost souls of dead people who lost their way to take them to the Other World. However you must avoid the Devourers that live in the Twilight Realm. They protected the souls that remain in this realm and will kill you if you aren't carefull.

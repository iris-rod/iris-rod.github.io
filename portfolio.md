# BSc Projects

## Gestura: Game with gestures using Leap Motion

This was a game that I made in my final project in my BSc in Computer Engeneering and Multimedia. It is a turn-based fighting multiplayer game created in Unity that uses the Leap Motion sensor, allowing the player to use his own hands to play the game, instead of using the traditional keyboard and mouse or controller.

## Other smaller projects

### Hive
This was the final project of one of the programming classes I took in my first year of BSc. We had to create the board game Hive in Java from scratch with all of the different rules of movement for each piece.
 
### Soul Syphon
This was also a final project for one of the programming classes of my first year of BSc. We had to create a game, in Python, based on three mechanics:
- There had to be some type of 'diver';
- 'Treasures' to the 'diver' collect;
- The 'diver' had to avoid 'sharks';

Since the concept could be changed, Soul Syphon was born. You roam the Twilight Realm as the Grim Reaper collecting the lost souls of dead people who lost their way to take them to the Other World. However you must avoid the Devourers that live in the Twilight Realm. They protected the souls that remain in this realm and will kill you if you aren't carefull.

## 42 Pieces of Story
This game had an initial version created during the classes of Game Design and a second and final one created during the classes of Game Development and Methodology. In the first version, you are a young men who wakes up in a village burning down and you hear the screams of a little girl. You don't recall anything about who you are, where you are and what has happened with you, and your only companion on your Journey is a shape shifting weapon that is with you when you wake up and it is able to talk to you.

In the second version, you are a young man living a quiet life in your small peacefull village, when suddenly everything changes. You wake up to a destroyed land where there used to be so much life. You begin your journey to try and rebuild your village, helping others and fnding out who turn your home into a hellish place.

## Game to teach Organic Chemistry
This is the final project of my MSc which I am currently working on. It is a game to teach Organic Chemistry to highschool students that uses Virtual Reality technology and the Leap Motion sensor. The player is immersed in a virtual world where he can grab atoms with his own hands and create and manipulate molecules.

The game is based on what the students need to learn in highschool and it has several challenges such as, creating molecules from scratch, transform a molecule from a functional group into another, complete a partially built molecule knowing what it's struture is and answering different questions about the molecules.

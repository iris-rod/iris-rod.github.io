## Breaking Dev 2018 Participation

I participated in the Breaking Dev 2018 edition at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico Campus TagusPark and created another multiplayer game, this time in a two-man team. We made it all from scratch, except the sounds. It was a full-on weekend of drawing and coding, but it was a lot of fun!

Dare to face your fears in your own dreams with the help of your trust worthy teddy bear!

## Global Game Jam 2018 Participation
I participated in the Global Game Jam 2018 edition and created a fun multiplayer game with some friends. 

Three amigos from the latino side of America want to feed their family and get a nice job in the land of the free. But there is only one passport! 
Cooperate with your fellows to cross the border without getting caught by the Immigration Control.

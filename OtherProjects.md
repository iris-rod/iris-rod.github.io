# Other Projects

## Programming projects

There are projects where my main role was as a programmer. Fortunatelly, I've done some projects where we had an artist, so the programmers could focus entirely on programming and nothing else. This are the projects I love doing the most, since I can improve my abilities, work in a group of people with different responsabilities and knowledge and learn from them.

### Global Game Jam 2020 Participation

"Two Giant Stars have just merged together affecting several of the inhabited planets nearby, Many species are in danger of extinction, and it is up to you to change that. In RE-Evolution, you are a robotic worker of the Re-adaptation Species Space Company working tirelessly to change the species of your planets representative clients."

In this Global Game Jam we were more artists than programmers, there were 3 artists and 2 programmers (one of them was me)! This meant that we had really good art and animations to work with, which made us really excited. Unfortunatelly, we were way too ambitious with our ideas and in the end, we left out some of the work the artists made because we didn't have time to add everything with the gameplay.

The game was heavily inspired by Overcooked where there are 'orders' that come in and the players need to put the items together properly to deliver the 'order' correctly. In our case, the orders are combinations of body parts of different animals, for example, fish legs, duck head and crocodile body. To create the body parts, you have to pick up the essence of the animal and the body part, put them in the cauldron and it will combine the two to create the desired result. After that, you shoot it at the default doll passing by on the rails to set it! The game can have up to 4 players, creating more mayhem and caos when trying to get the orders right and get the most points.

My role in this was combining the body parts with the animal essences to generate the correct combination, as well as the rails and order system, which included generation the orders, replacing the default body part on the doll with the body part that was shot through the cannon and the rails movement.

I worked on the game for a while after the jam ended to improve it and improve my skills at the same time.

### Global Game Jam 2019 Participation

"It's cleaning day and the whole family has to clean up the house! However, not everyone agrees on what should go where. The toilet paper doesn't always show up in the bathroom, and some socks are stored away in the kitchen. Try to clean the house the way that makes you feel like home!"

For this year Global Game Jam we had a pretty awesome team of 3 programmers (me included) and 1 artist, which meant we could create not only good gameplay mechanics but also cool and original art! Our game consisted on having 4 players and 3 items in the house, the player that cleans up the most items in their right place, wins. However, since there are fewer items than players, they will have to be faster and tackle the others to get the most points. The biggest downside to this version is that it was designed for 4 players, so if you play with less people, it will not have the same feel. 

My part on this jam consisted on randomnly generating the different items on the level and checking if the player was delivering the item to the right room. I also added some sound effects and special effects (the good old friends, particle systems) to enhance the feedback that the player had from the actions he performed.

### Global Game Jam 2018 Participation

"Three amigos from the latino side of America want to feed their family and get a nice job in the land of the free. But there is only one passport! 
Cooperate with your fellows to cross the border without getting caught by the Immigration Control."

I participated in the Global Game Jam 2018 edition and created a fun multiplayer game with some friends. My job on the team was to create differet types of traps to be set in different levels as a way to increase the difficulty as the players progress through the game.

## Artist projects

These are projects that I participated more as an artist instead of a programmer. Although my focus is programming, I have some skills at drawing and animating, so when I'm in a group where we don't have any artist and we want to have coherent and original art, I take that role and my priority becomes the art. I enjoy doing these projects because it helps me to understand a little better the artist side, what they need to do, how they do it, how much time and requirements they need to do what they are asked, among other things.

### Sugar Jam Participation

This game jam was a different experience from the previous game jams that I had already participated in, but still fun and a good opportunity to explore new things. The whole concept of this jam was to use Sugar, a social gamification asset that helps adding competitive, cooperative and goal based mechanics. We were a team of 3, all programmers, and we decided to make a joust like game between robots. You built your robot with different parts (machine gun, shield, cannon,...) which are represented as cards, and fight other player's robot to win more cards. The judges of the game jam gaves the third place, which was really good and showed us that our hard work was recognized!

I made the robots parts and animated them using the Puppet 2D asset from Unity. This made it easier to create cool animations to the different body parts of the robot without having to create several sprites. It was a challenging and fun concept to tackle in this game jam and, although there are a lot of things I would improve, it was a good way to learn a bit more about animation.

### Breaking Dev 2018 Participation

"Dare to face your fears in your own dreams with the help of your trust worthy teddy bear!"

I participated in the Breaking Dev 2018 edition at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico Campus TagusPark and created another multiplayer game, this time in a two-man team. We made it all from scratch, except the sounds and my main focus was the art and animations, which was the first time I had ever done it. Everything was drawn using Gimp and I made the character's and enemie's animations frame by frame, which took along time, but it was very enlightning to understand the process of drawing a full animation. They didn't turn out the prettiest or the best, but it was a great learning experience and a nice change from coding (although I realised I really do enjoy implementing mechanics more than drawing and animating). Overall, it was a full-on weekend of drawing and coding, but it was a lot of fun!

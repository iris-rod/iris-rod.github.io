## Global Game Jam 2019 Participation

"It's cleaning day and the whole family has to clean up the house! However, not everyone agrees on what should go where. The toilet paper doesn't always show up in the bathroom, and some socks are stored away in the kitchen. Try to clean the house the way that makes you feel like home!"

For this year Global Game Jam we had a pretty awesome team of 3 programmers (me included) and 1 artist, which meant we could create not only good gameplay mechanics but also cool and original art! My part on this jam consisted on randomnly generating the different items on the level and checking if the player was delivering the item to the right room. I also added some sound effects and special effects (the good old friends, particle systems) to enhance the feedback that the player had from the actions he performed.

## Sugar Jam Participation

This game jam was a different experience from the previous game jams that I had already participated in, but still fun and a good opportunity to explore new things. The whole concept of this jam was to use Sugar, a social gamification asset that helps adding competitive, cooperative and goal based mechanics. We were a team of 3, all programmers, and we decided to make a joust like game between robots. You built your robot with different parts (machine gun, shield, cannon,...) which are represented as cards that you can win through the jousting.

I made the robots parts and animated them using the Puppet 2D asset from Unity. This made it easier to create cool animations to the different body parts of the robot without having to create several sprites. It was a challenging and fun concept to tackle in this game jam and, although there are a lot of things I would improve, it was a good way to learn a bit more about animation.

## Breaking Dev 2018 Participation

"Dare to face your fears in your own dreams with the help of your trust worthy teddy bear!"

I participated in the Breaking Dev 2018 edition at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico Campus TagusPark and created another multiplayer game, this time in a two-man team. We made it all from scratch, except the sounds and my focus was on all the art and animations, which was the first time I had ever done it. It was a full-on weekend of drawing and coding, but it was a lot of fun!

## Global Game Jam 2018 Participation

"Three amigos from the latino side of America want to feed their family and get a nice job in the land of the free. But there is only one passport! 
Cooperate with your fellows to cross the border without getting caught by the Immigration Control."

I participated in the Global Game Jam 2018 edition and created a fun multiplayer game with some friends. My job on the team was to create differet types of traps to be set in different levels as a way to increase the difficulty as the players progress through the game.

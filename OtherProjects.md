## Global Game Jam 2018 Participation
I participated in the Global Game Jam 2018 edition and created a fun multiplayer game with some friends. 

Three amigos from the latino side of America want to feed their family and get a nice job in the land of the free. But there is only one passport! 
Cooperate with your fellows to cross the border without getting caught by the Immigration Control.

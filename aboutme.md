## About Me

Graduated from my MSc in Information Systems and Computer Engeneering at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico (IST), Universidade de Lisboa. The focus of my MSc was in Video Games and Interaction and Visualization, and I am currently working in my first full-time job at a tech company (but always hopefull for a future in video games).

Recently started working at Miniclip as a Junior Software Programmer after working in mobile apps development for a couple of years.

Currently I'm focusing on learning C++ and fiddle around with the Unreal Engine, and I'm always down for a game jam.

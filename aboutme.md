## About Me
I am in my final year of MSc in Information Systems and Computer Engeneering at Instituto Superior Técnico (IST), Universidade de Lisboa. The focus of my MSc is in Video Games and Interaction and Visualization.

My MSc advisor is Prof. [Rui Prada](http://gaips.inesc-id.pt/rprada) from GAIPS at Instituto Superior Técnico, Universidade de Lisboa. I'm currently working on my dissertation on a game to teach Organic Chemistry to highschool students using Virtual Reality.
